# aws_announcement_scraper
This contains the simple scripts and binaries to get AWS new service announcements by year.

Pretty simple. On a linux or Mac environment, simply do

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python3 scrape_aws_announcements.py`

Follow the prompt (it will ask you for a year) and it will then
generate a `.csv` file with each row being a new service announcement for that year.


Windows Users: You can run the `announcementscraper.exe` to the same effect!
